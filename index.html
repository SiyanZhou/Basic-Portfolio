        <p>User experience design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility,
            and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.User experience design encompasses traditional humanâ€“computer
            interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.
        </p>

        <p>Poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic example of this is the Three
            Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine
            interface was at least partly responsible for the disaster.[8][9][10] Similarly, accidents in aviation have resulted
            from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instrument or throttle quadrant layouts: even though
            the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine interaction, pilots had already ingrained
            the "standard" layout and thus the conceptually good idea actually had undesirable results.</p>

        <p>Humans interact with computers in many ways; the interface between humans and computers is crucial to facilitating
            this interaction. Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld computers, and computer kiosks make use of
            the prevalent graphical user interfaces (GUI) of today.[5] Voice user interfaces (VUI) are used for speech recognition
            and synthesising systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans to engage
            with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other interface paradigms. The growth in
            human-computer interaction field has been in quality of interaction, and in different branching in its history.
            Instead of designing regular interfaces, the different research branches have had a different focus on the concepts
            of multimodality rather than unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces rather than command/action based ones,
            and finally active rather than passive interfaces.[citation needed] For instance, more recently, sensors like
            video cameras and eye trackers can be used to feed physiological information of humans back to computer systems.[6][7]
            Such information can be used by computers to dynamically adapt content of interfaces. Thus, computers could develop
            responsiveness to cognitive load[7] and human emotion[6].</p>
